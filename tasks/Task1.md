Can you research and understand how Comfy UI works? And can you make a file watcher or a file watcher script that I'm going to run from one, like it's going to be one level above my Comfy UI installation? And I just wanted to watch my downloads folder. I'm on Novara Linux, and the folder that it's in, and all of the model folders, and all of the node folders for, I guess, all the custom node folders for Comfy UI. And I just want it basically to just be a current inventory of all of the items coming in or out. I guess the biggest problem there is, I guess, am I just reinventing this? Does Comfy UI do everything except for in the downloads folder?
